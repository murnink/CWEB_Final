			<h2> Loren Marsala </h2>
			<p>"My name is Loren and I've been painting off and on since I was a
			little girl. I remember going to my Grandmother's house in the summertime 
			and while all of the other kids played in the pool, my Gransmother would sit
			and teach me how to draw and paint. I love making and enjoying artwork today
			because it reminds me of her."</p>
			<br>
			<p>"I like to paint still-life but since we hit October I've been working on drawing
			and painting the human body."</p>
			<br>
			<p>"I get my art supplies from Michael's or Hobby Lobby for the most part but if
			I'm in a pinch I'll run to Walmart to get what I need."</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="item5">
			<h2> Nina Murphy </h2>
			<p>"I've always been interested in creating things. When
			I was little it started with drawing, then painting, but around middle school
			I took ceramics classes and fell in love with the idea of creating solid objects for display/use. This
			interest went on to highschool and now my daily adult life.</p>
			<br>
			<p>"Since then, I realised that needle felting gave me the satisfaction of creating something solid while 
			also being a great coping method to every day stressors. What I more so mean by this is in reference to
			the process of needle felting - stabbing fabrics repeatedly into something very constructive, and the sound
			of it is also pretty satisfying."</p>
			<br>
			<p>"During my art classes in middle school I also joined an after school art club where we would try different
			styles of art. One of my favorites was wood-burning (pyrography). I love how it involves first drawing on your
			chosen piece, and then tracing it with hot tools to burn in special patterns. The opportunities to create
			any image are endless. The finished product is also beautiful, the natural
			element to wood is just something else."
			<br>
			<p>"I get most of my supplies from Michael's crafts and Amazon, specifically more so <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Needle-Felting-Kit-Included-Supplies/dp/B07MR3M78G/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=needle+felting+tools&qid=1638828180&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyQzBRRTFFQUJLUDdRJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODYwODE4M0hBQU5XNzZBVjBPUiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDA5ODE3MVdHVUQ5S001UTBFUyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=">Amazon</a> 
			for wool and tools. This is also where I got my first starter kit."</p>

		<div class="item6">
			<h2> Zi Josephine & Casey </h2>
			<p>"We love to create artwork and we love even more to have it seen. Stickers
			are a great way to do that because people can put them literally anywhere and everywhere,
			and they do!"</p>
			<br>
			<p>"We don't have a preferred art style as it is contantly changing but we love things
			that are more risqué as it's really just something that should be seen as normal. We
			try to keep it fun and risqué, that's why we like to combine (the concept of) bodies with
			various things. Really - we create what we like, and if other people like them too, that's
			great."</p>
			<br>
			<p>"We order stickers through <a href="https://stickerninja.com/">Sticker Ninja</a> 
			as they support their community, LGBTQ+ community, BIPOC communities, and their team members.
			We love being able to support a great company that also produces great products."</p>
