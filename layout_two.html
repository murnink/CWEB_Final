			<h1><i class="fas fa-palette"></i> Painting</h1>
				<p>According to <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-painting-definition-evolution-major-artists.html/">Study.com</a>, 
				Painting is one of the oldest art forms. When societies began crafting tools and making fire, 
				they were also learning to represent the world in pictures. These pictures were recorded in cave 
				paintings that still exist today. Some of the oldest paintings known to exist can be found in 
				the Chauvet Cave in France.</p>
				<p>Painting is a great way to express yourself through Art and take some time to relax, thinking
				of the little things we enjoy in life.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="item2">
			<h1><i class="fas fa-fire"></i> Pyrography (wood-burning)</h1>
				<p>Pyrography (or pyrogravure) is the free handed art of decorating wood or other materials 
				with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a 
				poker. It is also known as pokerwork or wood burning.</p>
				<p>According to <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/pyrography-wood-burning-art/">My Modern Met</a>, 
				the history of the craft dates back to the Egyptians and some African tribes, and in China it 
				was known as fire needle embroidery.</p>
				<p>Light-colored woods are typically used as a canvas for pyrography. Beech, birch, and sycamore 
				are perfect for showing off the artwork due to their coloring and light grain. Maple, pine, walnut, 
				and oak are also popular choices. For safety reasons, it's essential to use untreated wood. Check 
				out the link above for more in-depth infomation on Pyrography!</p>

		<div class="item3">
			<h1><i class="fas fa-map-pin"></i> Needle Felting</h1>
				<p>Needle Felting is exactly what it sounds like - creating forms of felt with barbed needles,
				you can felt with either dry or wet fabric. Felting can be done on almost any fabric or project 
				imaginable. Where wet felting requires the loose wool to be condensed into felt using hot or warm 
				water, dry felting allows the wool to be used as is. We will discuss dry felting here.</p>
				<p>“The felting needle is a technique of felting the fibre dry. ... No water, soap or anything else 
				just wool and a felting needle” and your next adventure is at hand”. Allows you to root wool into 
				the scalp of a Tricot cloth doll. Simply lay the doll hair and poke the felting needle in and out 
				of the fabric. The felting needle will catch the fibre and root it into the fabric. The needles 
				are also used for dry wool felting, known as waterless wool felting.</p>
				<p>Learning to dry felt may be as easy as looking for instructional videos online or purchasing 
				how-to books. In some areas, classes that teach felting techniques to beginners are hosted at 
				fabric stores and even local libraries.</p>

			<h1><i class="fas fa-sticky-note"></i> Sticker Art</h1>
				<p>Creating stickers, how do you do it? Well, if you already have a design in mind then you're halfway there!
				Designing the sticker is a very important step. You can draw your idea on paper and watch it transform into 
				a real sticky!</p>
